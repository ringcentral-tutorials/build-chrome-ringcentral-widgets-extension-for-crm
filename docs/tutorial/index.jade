      ## Prepare Your Environment

      Need nodejs 8.10+/npm, recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install nodejs/npm.

      Then let's create an extension project with [ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory](https://github.com/zxdong262/ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory):

      ```
      npx ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory my-app
      ```

      Looks like this:

      ![ ](https://github.com/zxdong262/ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory/raw/master/screenshots/cli.png)

      Then, after the project folder is created, install the necessary prerequisites:

      ```
      cd my-app

      # install dependencies
      npm i

      # create local config file
      cp config.sample.js config.js

      # edit config.js, set proper `thirdPartyConfigs.serviceName`

      # let's build the extension
      npm start

      # now my-app/dist is ready for use as extension source
      ```

  .step(data-title='Load extension to Chrome', data-file='../README.md', data-highlight='86-89')
    :markdown
      ## Now let's test the extension

      1. Go to Chrome extensions page.
      2. Open developer mode
      3. Load `dist` as unpacked package.
      4. Go to the CRM site to check

      ## Add features to extension

      You can see that without any coding, currently we just add the [ringcentral-embeddable](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-embeddable) Phone widgets, you call with it, but it is not interactive with CRM site yet, All those features listed need your coding efforts to make it work.

      To make it easier, we already set common modules to reduce developer efforts, you could set proper selectors, methods to make all features to work:

      - Edit [src/chrome-extension/config.js](src/chrome-extension/config.js) to make click-to-call related features to work
      - Follow the guide in [src/chrome-extension/features/third-party-api.js](src/chrome-extension/features/third-party-api.js) to make all third party features to work.
      - Further more you can edit [dist/manifest.json](dist/manifest.json) and [dist/background.js](dist/background.js) to do more customization work.
      - And you can always read [Realworld code examples](https://github.com/ringcentral-tutorials/build-chrome-ringcentral-widgets-extension-for-crm#realworld-code-examples) to get some hint about how to do it.
