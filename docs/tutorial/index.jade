      ## What does Chrome RingCentral widgets extension for CRM do?

      [Embbnux Ji](https://github.com/embbnux) has a tuturial: [Building Chrome Extension Integrations with RingCentral Embeddable](https://medium.com/ringcentral-developers/build-a-chrome-extension-with-ringcentral-embeddable-bb6faee808a3), with this tutorial, you could create Chrome extension for any site with RingCentral Embeddable, not just for CRM sites.

      In this tutorial, we will show you the advanced features the extension could provide for CRM sites.

      - For CRM contact phone number text, we make it click-to-call link.

      ![ ](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory/raw/master/screenshots/fac-1.png)

      - For CRM contact list, we will add a hover-to-show tooltip to show click-to-call button.

      ![cc](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory/raw/master/screenshots/fac-2.png)

      - For CRM contact info page, we will add a click-to-call button in proper position.

      ![ ](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory/raw/master/screenshots/fac-3.png)

      - Sync CRM contacts to our widgets after user authorize.

      ![ ](https://github.com/zxdong262/insightly-embeddable-ringcentral-phone/raw/master/screenshots/insightly-4.png)

      - Sync call log to CRM automatically or manually.

      ![ ](https://github.com/zxdong262/hubspot-embeddable-ringcentral-phone/raw/master/screenshots/hs6.png)

      - Check CRM contact activities from our widgets.

      ![ ](https://github.com/zxdong262/hubspot-embeddable-ringcentral-phone/raw/master/screenshots/hs7.png)

      - Show CRM contact info panel when inbound/outbound call with CRM contact.

      ## Demo video(Insightly)

      [https://youtu.be/Qfje5d5OdK0](https://youtu.be/Qfje5d5OdK0)

  .step(data-title='Init extension project', data-file='../README.md', data-highlight='68-99')
    :markdown
      ## Init extension project

      You need nodejs 8.10+/npm, recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install nodejs/npm.

      Then let's create an extension project with our CLI tool: [ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory):

      ```
      npx ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory my-app

      # make sure you set `https://*.insightly.com/*` as url, we will use insightly as target CRM site.
      ```
      - CLI tool promotes questions like name, decsription, url,
      - make sure you set `https://*.pipedrive.com/*` as url, since we will use pipedrive as target CRM site.

      Looks like this:

      ![ ](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory/raw/master/screenshots/cli.png)

      And there is a [video](https://youtu.be/2njQSk8x2K4) to show this too.

      Then, after the project folder is created, install the necessary prerequisites:

      ```
      cd my-app

      # install dependencies
      npm i

      # create local config file
      cp config.sample.js config.js

      # edit config.js, set `thirdPartyConfigs.serviceName` to `Pipedrive`

      # let's build the extension
      npm start

      # now dist folder is ready for use as extension source
      ```

  .step(data-title='Load extension to Chrome', data-file='../README.md', data-highlight='86-89')
    :markdown
      ## Now let's test the extension

      1. Go to Chrome extensions page.
      2. Open developer mode
      3. Load `dist` as unpacked package.
      4. Go to the [pipedrive.com](https://www.pipedrive.com), login and check it.

  .step(data-title='Add advanced features to extension', data-file='../template/content.js', data-highlight='30-56')
    :markdown
      ## Add advanced features to extension

      You can see that without any coding, currently we just add the [ringcentral-embeddable](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-embeddable) Phone widgets, you call with it, but it is not interactive with CRM site yet, All those features listed in previous chapter need your coding efforts to make it work.

      To make it easier, we already set common modules to reduce developer efforts, you could set proper selectors, methods to make all features to work:

      - Edit `src/content.js` to make all features to work
      - Further more you can edit `src/manifest.json` and `src/background.js` to do more customization work.
      - And you can always read [Realworld code examples](https://github.com/ringcentral-tutorials/build-chrome-ringcentral-widgets-extension-for-crm#realworld-code-examples) to get some hint about how to do it.

      In the following chapters, you will learn how exactly to make it work. This tutorial will take [pipedrive.com](https://www.pipedrive.com) as target CRM site, they have a modern single page app site.

      Before continuing, please register an free account, login and add some contacts with proper email and real contact number.

      ## Convert phone number text to click-to-call link

      ![ ](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory/raw/master/screenshots/fac-1.png)

      It is pretty simple, let's import config from `config.js`. we just need to find proper css selector.

      ![ ](images/numbers.png)

      And edit `src/config.js` `phoneNumberSelectors` to be like this:

      ```js
        // modify phone number text to click-to-call link
        export const phoneNumberSelectors = [
          ///* example config
          {
            urlCheck: (href) => {
              return /\/person\/\d+/.test(href)
            },
            selector: '[data-test="phone-label"]'
          }
          //*/
        ]
      ```

      Then refresh extension in Chrome extension page, check in pipedrive.com's contact detail page.


  .step(data-title='Add a click-to-call button in contact info page', data-file='../src/config.js', data-highlight='40-83')
    :markdown
      ## Add a click-to-call button in contact info page

      ![ ](images/btn.png)

      And edit `src/config.js` `insertClickToCallButton` to be like this:

      As you can see, pipedrive contact page just have all phone numbers info in dom,
      so we can just extract them from dom, since the code is a bit long, please check this link to compare the code:

      [source code compare](https://github.com/zxdong262/pipedrive-embeddable-ringcentral-phone-spa/commit/059e90c4cbbacc72c86437d8c16c43c30589b854)

      Then refresh extension in Chrome extension page, check in pipedrive.com's contact detail page.

      ![cc](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-embeddable-extension-factory/raw/master/screenshots/fac-2.png)

      If you get a sense of how the config works, now it is time to try it yourself.

      Edit `src/config.js` `hoverShowClickToCallButton` function to make this feature work.

      Think about your solution and compare with [source code](https://github.com/zxdong262/pipedrive-embeddable-ringcentral-phone-spa/commit/2ae121c266a44d555464080dd2e097ac7b59c7b6)

  .step(data-title='Add third party features', data-file='../src/config.js', data-highlight='132-282')
    :markdown
      ## Add third party features

      After the warn up, now it is time to try the third party features.

      Read our [third party document](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-embeddable/blob/master/docs/third-party-service-in-widget.md) first.

      If you want to try yourself, you could do it by edit `src/config.js`'s `thirdPartyServiceConfig` and `initThirdParty` function.

      In next chapter we will talk about authorization and sync contacts to RingCentral widgets.

  .step(data-title='Add third party features: authorization and contacts', data-file='../src/config.js', data-highlight='17-24')
    :markdown
      ## Add third party features: authorization and contacts

      ![ ](https://github.com/zxdong262/insightly-embeddable-ringcentral-phone/raw/master/screenshots/insightly-4.png)

      It is a common practice that getting user authorization before accessing user data.

      Since CRM site are so different, there is no common practice for this.

      In general, if you could access user data as logined user from browser, no special action needed.

      You may need to check network requests to find out how to get contacts list:

      ![ ](images/network.png)

      So we can set proper method to get pipedrive's conatct list, check the [source code compare](https://github.com/zxdong262/pipedrive-embeddable-ringcentral-phone-spa/commit/de6d30091e2f5de9f032e3e83a117efa088ecf08) to edit your code accordingly.

      After finish editing, refresh extension in Chrome extension page, check in pipedrive.com's contacts page, click contacts panel of RingCentral widgets, click auth button and try to call some contacts.

      ![ ](images/contacts.png)

  .step(data-title='Practice: The other third party features', data-file='../src/config.js', data-highlight='132-281')
    :markdown
      ## Practice: The other third party features

      Since contacts and authorization are done, we will leave you to finish the Syncing call log and showing contact activities features as a practice.

  .step(data-title='Practice: Additional settings', data-file='../src/background.js', data-highlight='1-17')
    :markdown
      ## Practice: Additional settings

      Further more you can edit `src/manifest.json` and `src/background.js` to do more customization work, such as filtered urls you do not want to show widgets etc.

      That is all, thanks for reading!
